# Pull Request: Event-Driven Architecture Implementation

## Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive event-driven architecture for the Verinode backend to decouple services, improve scalability, and enable better audit trails and reactive programming patterns.

## Changes Made

### 🏗️ Core Event System Files Created

- **`backend/src/events/EventBus.ts`** - Redis-based event bus with pub/sub, retry logic, and dead letter queue
- **`backend/src/events/EventHandlers.ts`** - Event handler registry with filtering and retry policies  
- **`backend/src/events/EventStore.ts`** - Event sourcing implementation with Redis storage
- **`backend/src/events/EventTypes.ts`** - Comprehensive type definitions for all events
- **`backend/src/services/events/EventService.ts`** - High-level API for event management
- **`backend/src/utils/eventUtils.ts`** - Utility functions for event processing
- **`backend/src/config/events.ts`** - Complete configuration system

### 🔧 Service Integration Updated

- **`backend/src/services/proofService.ts`** - Integrated with new event system while maintaining backward compatibility
- **`backend/src/services/UserService.ts`** - Already had good event integration (verified)
- **`backend/src/authService.ts`** - Already had event integration (verified)

### 📚 Documentation and Testing

- **`backend/src/events/README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
- **`backend/src/__tests__/eventSystem.test.ts`** - Integration test suite

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Met

- [x] **Redis-based event bus implementation** - Full Redis pub/sub with connection pooling
- [x] **Event sourcing for complete audit trails** - EventStore with time-based queries and replay
- [x] **Async event processing with retries** - Exponential backoff and configurable retry policies
- [x] **Event replay capabilities for debugging** - Time-based replay with filtering options
- [x] **Event filtering and routing** - Pattern-based routing and handler filtering
- [x] **Performance monitoring for event processing** - Real-time metrics and alerting
- [x] **Dead letter queue for failed events** - Automatic DLQ management with TTL
- [x] **Event schema validation** - Type-safe events with runtime validation
- [x] **Integration with existing services** - All services emit appropriate events
- [x] **Event monitoring and alerting** - Configurable alert rules and notifications

## 🚀 Key Features

### Event Types Implemented
- **Proof Events**: `PROOF_CREATED`, `PROOF_VERIFIED`, `PROOF_UPDATED`, `PROOF_DELETED`
- **User Events**: `USER_REGISTERED`, `USER_LOGGED_IN`, `USER_UPDATED`, `USER_DEACTIVATED`  
- **Auth Events**: `AUTH_TOKEN_GENERATED`, `AUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED`, `AUTH_FAILED`, `PASSWORD_CHANGED`
- **System Events**: `SYSTEM_ERROR`, `SYSTEM_METRIC`

### Performance & Scalability
- Redis pub/sub for high-throughput event delivery
- Connection pooling and automatic failover
- Batch processing support
- Configurable retention policies

### Reliability & Monitoring
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Dead letter queue for failed events
- Real-time metrics and statistics
- Alert rules with multiple notification channels

### Developer Experience
- Type-safe event definitions
- Comprehensive utility functions
- Detailed documentation and examples
- Integration test suite

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive integration test that verifies:
- Event creation and publishing
- Event validation and storage
- Event replay functionality
- Metrics and monitoring
- Multiple event type handling
- Alert rule configuration

Run tests with:
```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node src/__tests__/eventSystem.test.ts
```

## 📊 Performance Impact

- **Minimal performance degradation** - Event publishing is async and non-blocking
- **Redis optimization** - Connection pooling and efficient serialization
- **Configurable processing** - Batch sizes and timeouts can be tuned
- **Monitoring enabled** - Real-time visibility into event processing performance

## 🔧 Configuration

The system is highly configurable through environment variables:
- Redis connection settings
- Event retention policies
- Monitoring and alerting thresholds
- Security and rate limiting
- Performance optimization parameters

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

- Existing EventEmitter usage continues to work
- Gradual migration path available
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Legacy event emission maintained alongside new system

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Decoupling** - Services communicate through events rather than direct calls
2. **Scalability** - Event-driven architecture supports horizontal scaling
3. **Audit Trail** - Complete event history for compliance and debugging
4. **Reactive Programming** - Build responsive systems that react to state changes
5. **Observability** - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities
6. **Reliability** - Retry logic, DLQ, and error handling ensure robust operation

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

None - This implementation maintains full backward compatibility.

## 📝 Migration Guide

See `backend/src/events/README.md` for detailed migration instructions.
